NFInvesT

Trying to connect small-medium businesses with investors world wide! We are developing a decentralized application (
dApp) designed to link businesses with investors globally. Our platform allows users to explore shares of companies that
register on our website. Upon registration, each business generates a single ERC-20 token, symbolizing complete
ownership (100%) of the company.

When seeking investment, a business can list a portion of this token on our marketplace—for instance, 0.10 of the token,
representing a 10% stake—at a price they determine. This setup transforms our platform into a blockchain-based version
of "Shark Tank" or "Dragon's Den," but on chain!
